The working directory was /home/lecture1/messages
The output was supposed to change to the directory in the argument, but since I gave no arguments, it changed it to /home
It was not an error

2. With a path to a directory as an argument

The output was supposed to change to the directory in the argument, so it changed it to /home/lecture1
It was not an error

The output was supposed to change to the directory in the argument, but since the argument provided was not a directory, it returned an error.
