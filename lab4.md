Keys pressed: `<up> <enter>`.
I pressed `<up>` so I could find the `ssh dsaldanhadaluzfontes@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command in my bash history, and pressed `<enter>` to run it. Due to my ssh key, this command instantly logged me in to my ieng6 account

Keys pressed: `c s 1 5 l <tab> <enter>`. I typed `c s 1 5 l` to start going into my workspace for this course, then, pressed `<tab` to autocomplete the rest, and `<enter>` to run the command. This put me into `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi24/dsaldanhadaluzfontes`, where I can execute the rest of the tasks

Keys pressed: `g i t <space> c l o n e <space> <ctrl>+v <enter>`. I typed the  `git clone ` command because I want to clone a git repository. Then, I pressed `<ctrl>+v` to paste the ssh URL of my private fork into the terminal, and `<enter>` to run it. Due to my GitHub ssh key, I was able to clone the private repository into my working directory.

Keys pressed: `c d <space> <shift>+c <tab> <enter>`. I typed the `cd ` command because I want to change directory, then `<shift>+c` to type `C`, the first character of the name of the directory I cloned the repository into, and `<tab> <enter>` to autocomplete and run, as it was the only directory in my working directory whose name started with `C`.

Keys pressed: `l s <enter>`. I ran the `ls` command to list the files in the working directory, so I could remember the names of the files I needed to use.

Keys pressed: `b a s h <space> t <tab> <enter>`. I typed the `bash ` command because I want to run a `.sh` file. Then I typed `t <tab>` because t is the first letter of the name of the `test.sh` file i want to run, and nothing else in the current directory has a name starting in t. Then I pressed `<enter>`, which ran the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` and `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` commands in the `test.sh` file.
